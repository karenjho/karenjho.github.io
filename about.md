I love working with people, code, and data. My background in analysis and marketing has taught me how to tease out the critical facts from data, and how to turn those facts into stories. Iâ€™m interested in web development opportunities where I can help others share their lives and work in meaningful ways.

I also bake a killer pumpkin pie. (Ask me about the secret in the crust.)
